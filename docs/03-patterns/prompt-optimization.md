## **How to Write Few-Shot Scenario Examples for Optimized Task Prompts:**

A **few-shot example** helps LLM models understand the desired behavior by providing one or more example scenarios with a clear input-output relationship. These examples are useful for training or prompting the model to understand how it should act in similar real-world situations.

### **Steps to Write Effective Few-Shot Scenarios:**
1. **Identify the Task or Business Context**: Determine the task or business process the assistant is expected to perform (e.g., appointment booking, information retrieval, customer support).
2. **Write Clear Scenarios**: Create scenarios based on actual situations the assistant might encounter. Each scenario should present a user input and a corresponding assistant output.
3. **Provide Context**: Ensure that each example contains enough context for the assistant to understand the user's situation.
4. **Demonstrate Proper Response**: The assistant's response should align with the rules and guidelines outlined in the task prompt. This shows the assistant how to appropriately handle the situation.
5. **Add Edge Cases**: Include some less common but important cases that help the assistant understand how to respond in different contexts or when the user provides incomplete information.

### **Key Points for Few-Shot Examples:**
- **Consistency**: Make sure the examples maintain consistency with the language and behavior expected from the assistant.
- **Clear Structure**: Use a structured format with clear distinctions between the user's input and the assistant's response.

#### Scenario: Ransomware Outbreak Detection
User: "Multiple users reporting encrypted files and ransomware notes on their workstations. How do we contain this quickly?"

CORRECT RESPONSE: "This appears to be an active ransomware outbreak requiring immediate containment. Here's a prioritized response approach:

1. Emergency containment:
   - Disconnect affected systems from the network immediately (physical network disconnection preferred)
   - If spread is rapid, consider temporary shutdown of non-critical network segments
   - Disable potentially compromised accounts, especially those with elevated privileges
   - Block any identified command-and-control domains/IPs at firewall and DNS
   
2. Outbreak mapping:
   - Quickly identify common characteristics of affected systems
   - Determine potential patient zero through chronological analysis
   - Identify the ransomware variant from ransom notes if possible
   - Check email systems for potential phishing delivery vectors

3. Evidence collection (while containing):
   - Capture disk images or memory dumps from selected infected systems
   - Preserve ransom notes and encrypted file samples
   - Collect relevant logs before system isolation when possible
   - Secure backup systems and verify their integrity

4. Critical systems protection:
   - Verify domain controllers and backup infrastructure are secured
   - Implement additional monitoring on critical business systems
   - Review and possibly enhance protection of unaffected critical systems
   - Verify offline backups are truly isolated from the network

5. Communication:
   - Alert all users to disconnect from the network and stop work immediately
   - Establish out-of-band communication channel with response team
   - Prepare initial notification for management with known facts only
   - Begin tracking systems and potential data impact for reporting purposes
